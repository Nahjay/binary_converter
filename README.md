# binary_converter

## Overview
This Arduino project creates a simple binary LED display where the user can input a number between 0 and 15, and the corresponding LEDs will light up to represent the binary value of that number.

## Hardware Setup
- You'll need an Arduino board and four LEDs connected to pins 13, 12, 11, and 10.
- Make sure to connect appropriate current-limiting resistors for the LEDs.

## Usage
1. Upload the Arduino code to your board.
2. Open the Arduino Serial Monitor.
3. You will be prompted to enter a number between 0 and 15.
4. Once you enter a valid number, the LEDs will display the binary representation of that number.
5. Invalid inputs will result in an "Invalid input" message.

## Example
- If you enter `5`, the binary LED display will look like this: `0101`.
